### Description

> What happens if I turn off session.upload? This challenge is almost identical to HITCON CTF 2018â€™s challenge One Line PHP Challenge (Tribute to orange). Plz read the docker file and show me your shell.

The Dockerfile using Ubuntu 18.04, and get php via `apt-get`, which version is php 7.2.24. But the environment need php version < 7.2.13.

So i copy the [dnmp](https://github.com/yeszao/dnmp) repo and modify it, hope you enjoy it :)
